# BFT-like Consensus Mechanism Prototype

## Overview

This project is a TypeScript implementation of a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)-like consensus mechanism, designed to simulate block production in a distributed system. It demonstrates the core principles of consensus algorithms used in blockchain and distributed ledger technologies.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or later)
- npm (v10 or later)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bft-consensus.git
cd bft-consensus
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Project

Use `ts-node` directly:

```bash
npx ts-node index.ts
```

## Key Concepts

### Consensus Mechanism

- Implements a Byzantine Fault Tolerance-like consensus
- Supports multiple validators
- Handles block proposal and validation
- Uses 2/3 + 1 majority rule for decision making

### Message Types

- `PREPARE`: Validators acknowledge block proposal
- `COMMIT`: Validators commit to including the block
- `NEW_ROUND`: Signals start of a new consensus round

## Placeholder Implementations

Note: This is a prototype with several placeholder implementations:

- Signature generation
- Message verification
- Block hash calculation
- Network broadcasting

## Extending the Project

Potential improvements:

1. Implement actual cryptographic signatures
2. Add network communication layer
3. Create more robust error handling
4. Implement state synchronization
5. Add view change protocol

## Troubleshooting

### Error Handling

The example includes basic error catching in the `simulateConsensusRound()` function.
